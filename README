# Work in progress.

"PCRTT" is a posix compliant port of the csa colibri toolchain tool.

# Why the port ? :
1) Firstly, because I wanted to try to port it.
2) It was a good way of training, to learn Cuda, OpenCL, and many other
   SDK/Tool chain.
3) Because I have free time to spent on this tool.

# The goal
The most perfect posix compliant tool as possible.

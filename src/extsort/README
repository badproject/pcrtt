Welcome To External Sorting Library Project

This is a C/C++ library for out of core sorting. The main API function in this library is ExSort . The usage of this API function is shown below. An implementation of an external sorting program ex-sort is also available. Its usage is also shown below.
Download
The API is currently well tested in 32-bit machines. Currently binary versions are available or GNU/Linux/i686 (libexsort.a). If you want to build on other platforms please download the source at (release.0.9.src.tgz). The source should be compiled with any C compiler supporting C99 standards. You can always checkout a last copy of the source code using cvs as follows.

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@lib-ex-sort.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lib-ex-sort co lib-ex-sort

Usage of the API function.

Download the library (libexsort.a) or build it from the source and include the header file ExternalSortAPI.h in your compiler include path to use it.

DESC: External Sort API function.
INPUT:
1.  in_file: name of the file containing keys to sort.
2. out_file: name of the file to save the sorted keys.
3. KEY_SIZE: size of each key in bytes, 
4. col_start: the bytes between [col_start, col_end] will be used
              used to compare the keys during sorting. 
5. col_end:  see above. 
6. endian: either 0 or 1 (if 0 sorts the bytes between [col_start, col_end]
           from left right, otherwise sorts from right to left).

=============================================
void ExSort(const char *in_file, const char *out_file, unsigned char KEY_SIZE,
            unsigned char col_start, unsigned char col_end, unsigned char endian);
=============================================

Usage of the sorting program.

USAGE: ./ex-sort {KEY_SIZE} {SORT-KEY-START} {SORT-KEY-END} {in-file} {out-file} {endian}

The following shows an example on how to use the ex-sort program to sort a text file with fixed with keys of 36 bytes (37 including the new line). The following example shows the use of ex-sort to sort the first two bytes of each key.
